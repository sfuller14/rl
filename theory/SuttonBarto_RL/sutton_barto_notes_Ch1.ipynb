    "Four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Policy ($\\pi$)**: The agent's way of behaving at a given time by mapping from perceived environment states to actions to be taken (or action probabilities) when in those states. \n",
    "   - $\\pi$ is the agent's decision-making algorithm (akin to \"stimulus-response rules\")\n",
    "   - $\\pi(s)$ is the action that policy $\\pi$ outputs when given state $s$ as input\n",
    "   - So $\\pi$ is the agent's \"mapping\" from environment states to actions $\\pi(s)$ (deterministic) (or $\\pi(a|s)$ (stochastic))\n",
    "      - In the stochastic case ($\\pi(a|s)$), a policy specifies probabilities for each action\n",
    "   - Can be a lookup table or simple function or an extensive computation (like search)\n",
    "   - Policy alone is is sufficient to determine agent behavior\n",
    "   - Notation:\n",
    "      - $\\pi(s)$: Action taken in state $s$ under deterministic policy $\\pi$\n",
    "         - Example:\n",
    "            - If $\\pi(s_1) = a_3$, this means \"when in state $s_1$, the policy chooses action $a_3$\"\n",
    "               - The policy $\\pi$ is the overall mapping/function, but $\\pi(s)$ is the concrete action value it returns\n",
    "         - This is analogous to how $f(x)$ represents the output value of function $f$ when given input $x$, not the function itself.\n",
    "      - $\\pi(a \\mid s)$: Probability of taking action $a$ in state $s$ under stochastic policy $\\pi$\n",
    "         - Example:\n",
    "            - If $\\pi(left \\mid s_1) = 0.7$ and $\\pi(right \\mid s_1) = 0.3$, this means \"when in state $s_1$, choose left with 70% probability and right with 30% probability\"\n",
    "            - The agent samples from this probability distribution to decide which action to take\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reward Signal ($r$)**: The immediate environmental feedback signal received by the agent at each time step. It is a single number. The agent's sole objective is to maximize the _total_ reward it receives over the long term.\n",
    "   - $r_t$ is the reward received at time step $t$ (akin to pain/pleasure from taking an action).\n",
    "   - Reward $r$ is a key variable in defining **Return ($G_t$)**, which is the **cumulative future reward, often discounted**: \n",
    "      $$G_t = r_{t+1} + \\gamma r_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 r_{t+3} + \\dots$$\n",
    "      - To compare to financial theory, $r_t$ is like a future cashflow and $G_t$ is like the present value of future cash flows.\n",
    "      - Note that Return $G_t$ is a random variable (since future rewards are uncertain) whose true expected value we want to estimate.\n",
    "         - **In RL, the point is generally to find an optimal policy $\\pi^*$ that maximizes the _EXPECTED_ Return from each state.**\n",
    "         - The _EXPECTED_ Return is what the value functions estimate. Your estimate of expected long-term reward is called the \"value function\".\n",
    "            - So your overall goal is to find the optimal policy $\\pi^*$. You do this by estimating value functions (expected cumulative reward) for your current policy $\\pi$, then using those estimates to improve $\\pi$ toward $\\pi^*$.\n",
    "   - See the note below on learnable parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Value Function ($v(s)$, $q(s,a)$)**:\n",
    "   - Estimates long-term reward (expected return) from states or state-action pairs.\n",
    "   - The value function is the agent's \"learned intuition\" about how good different situations are\n",
    "   - **$v_\\pi(s)$**: Expected return from state $s$ under policy $\\pi$ - \"How good is this state if I follow my current policy?\"\n",
    "      - V-value: $V(s)$ = expected return from state $s$ following the policy\n",
    "      - \"How good is this state?\"\n",
    "   - **$q_\\pi(s, a)$**: Expected return from taking action $a$ in state $s$, then following policy $\\pi$ - \"How good is this specific action in this state?\"\n",
    "      - Q-value: $Q(s,a)$ = expected return from taking action $a$ in state $s$, then following the policy\n",
    "      - \"How good is this specific action in this state?\"\n",
    "   - Value functions guide decision-making more than immediate rewards because they capture long-term consequences\n",
    "   - Unlike rewards (which are given by the environment), value functions are learned estimates that improve over time\n",
    "   - Think of value functions as the agent's \"experience-based predictions\" about future success\n",
    "   - In practice, value functions help answer: \"Should I be optimistic or pessimistic about my current situation?\"\n",
    "   - Notation:\n",
    "      - $v_\\pi(s)$: State value function - expected cumulative reward starting from state $s$\n",
    "      - $q_\\pi(s, a)$: Action-value function (Q-function) - expected cumulative reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$\n",
    "      - Both represent the same underlying concept (expected return) but from different starting points\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model (optional)**:\n",
    "   - Simulates environment behavior: $p(s', r \\mid s, a)$ - \"If I take action $a$ in state $s$, what state will I end up in and what reward will I get?\"\n",
    "   - The model is the agent's internal representation of how the world works\n",
    "   - Enables **planning** (model-based) vs. **direct interaction** (model-free)\n",
    "   - **Model-based RL**: Agent learns a model of the environment, then uses it to plan optimal actions (like playing out scenarios in your head)\n",
    "   - **Model-free RL**: Agent learns directly from experience without explicitly modeling the environment (like learning to ride a bike through practice)\n",
    "   - Models can be:\n",
    "      - **Perfect**: Complete knowledge of environment dynamics (rare in practice)\n",
    "      - **Learned**: Estimated from experience (common in model-based RL)\n",
    "      - **Absent**: No model used (model-free methods like Q-learning)\n",
    "   - Trade-off: Models enable faster learning through planning, but require additional computational resources and can be inaccurate\n",
    "   - Example: A chess program might model \"if I move my queen here, my opponent will likely respond with these\n"

    "### Answers & Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Exercise 1.1: Self-Play**\n",
    "**Q:** What happens if the RL algorithm plays against itself, both sides learning? Would it learn a different policy for selecting moves?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:**  \n",
    "If both sides learn via self-play, the algorithm can converge to an optimal (or near-optimal) policy for both players, potentially leading to a policy that is robust to strong opponents, not just random ones. The learned policy may differ from what is learned against a random opponent, as the distribution of experiences will be more challenging and realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:**  \n",
    "Self-play is foundational in RL for learning robust strategies, as seen in AlphaGo/AlphaZero. This question builds intuition for learning from interaction with non-stationary or improving opponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Exercise 1.2: Symmetries**\n",
    "**Q:** How might we amend the learning process to exploit board symmetries? How would this help? Should we still do this if the opponent does not exploit symmetries? Do symmetric positions necessarily have the same value?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:**  \n",
    "We can exploit symmetries by treating symmetric board positions as equivalent, updating their values together, which reduces the state space and improves data efficiency. This accelerates learning because knowledge from one symmetric state transfers to others.  \n",
    "If the opponent does *not* exploit symmetries, we may still benefit, but symmetric positions could end up having different practical values due to asymmetric play. Symmetric positions *should* have the same value only if the opponent's policy is itself symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:**  \n",
    "This introduces the idea of state abstraction and function approximation—core to generalization and sample efficiency in RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Exercise 1.3: Greedy Play**\n",
    "**Q:** What happens if the player always acts greedily (never explores)? Might it learn to play better or worse than a non-greedy player? What problems can occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:**  \n",
    "A purely greedy player risks converging to suboptimal policies due to lack of exploration (\"getting stuck\" in local optima), and may never discover better moves. In practice, this can lead to worse performance compared to a player who explores and updates values more broadly. Problems include incomplete learning and overfitting to initial experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:**  \n",
    "This exercise motivates the importance of exploration in RL (vs. exploitation), foundational for concepts like $\\epsilon$-greedy, softmax, and exploration-exploitation tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Exercise 1.4: Learning from Exploration**\n",
    "**Q:** What if learning updates occur after all moves (including exploratory)? What are the two sets of probabilities? Which method is better for learning/winning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:**  \n",
    "- **If we update after all moves (including exploratory):** The value estimates reflect the actual probabilities with which moves are taken, blending greedy and exploratory choices.\n",
    "- **If we update only after greedy moves:** The values reflect the policy if only the best-known moves are always chosen.\n",
    "- Continuing to make exploratory moves but learning only from greedy moves focuses learning on the policy we intend to follow for winning, which usually results in better performance than learning from all moves (which blends exploration into the policy).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:**  \n",
    "This foreshadows \"on-policy\" vs. \"off-policy\" learning distinctions and highlights how the target of updates matters in RL algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Exercise 1.5: Other Improvements**\n",
    "**Q:** What other ways can we improve the RL player? Any better way to solve the tic-tac-toe problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:**  \n",
    "Possible improvements:\n",
    "- Use deeper lookahead (planning) or tree search.\n",
    "- Incorporate opponent modeling.\n",
    "- Use value function approximation (e.g., neural nets).\n",
    "- Exploit more domain knowledge (e.g., forced moves).\n",
    "- Enhance exploration strategy (e.g., UCB, optimism).\n",
    "For tic-tac-toe, full minimax search can solve the game exactly, but the RL approach generalizes to much harder problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:**  \n",
    "This encourages thinking about RL's flexibility and limitations, foreshadowing the use of model-based planning, opponent modeling, and advanced function approximation.\n",
