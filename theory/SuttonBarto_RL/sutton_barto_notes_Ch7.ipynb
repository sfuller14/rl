    "# Chapter 7: n-step Bootstrapping\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chapter Overview**: This chapter bridges Monte Carlo (MC) methods (Chapter 5) and one-step temporal-difference (TD) methods (Chapter 6) by introducing n-step TD methods. These generalize both approaches, allowing a smooth shift between them based on task needs. n-step methods form a spectrum: MC at one end (full episode backups) and one-step TD at the other (single-step backups). Intermediate n often performs best, balancing bias-variance trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: Neither pure MC (high variance, low bias) nor one-step TD (low variance, higher bias) is always optimal. n-step methods tune the bootstrapping amount for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sidenote**: Bootstrapping means updating estimates based on other estimates (like TD), reducing variance but introducing bias if estimates are poor. MC avoids bootstrapping by waiting for actual returns, but suffers from high variance in long episodes.\n",

    "**Core Idea**: Estimate value function $v_\\pi$ using n-step updates—look ahead n steps, then bootstrap from the estimated value at step n.\n",

    "- MC: Update based on all rewards until episode end (no bootstrapping).\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 7.1 Solution\n",
    "**Q**: In learning curves such as those shown in Figure 7.2, asymptote is offset slightly above 0 due to the off-by-0.5-step problem (random walk starts in center state 10, true values range 1/20 to 19/20). Can you explain why? What would the asymptotic error be if $\\gamma=0.9$?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: \n",
    "- Asymptotic RMS error isn't zero because learned values approximate $v_\\pi$, but true values are offset (e.g., from center, expected return is average of left/right paths).\n",
    "- With $\\gamma=0.9$, error scales by discount; asymptotic error would be $0.5 \\times (1 - \\gamma) = 0.05$ (general undiscounted bias persists, but discounted reduces effective offset).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 7.2 Solution\n",
    "**Q**: Why does off-policy MC control require $\\pi$ is greedy wrt $Q$, while on-policy MC does not?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: Off-policy separates behavior ($b$, exploratory) and target ($\\pi$, greedy). Greedy $\\pi$ ensures optimality; on-policy uses single improving policy, converging to optimal without explicit greediness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 7.3 Solution\n",
    "**Q**: Why larger random walk (19 vs 5 states)? Effect of smaller walk or left reward -1 vs 0 on best n?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: \n",
    "- Larger: Amplifies variance in MC (longer episodes), shifts optimum n rightward.\n",
    "- Smaller: Favors larger n (closer to MC).\n",
    "- -1 left: Increases variance asymmetry; may favor slightly smaller n for stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 7.4 Solution\n",
    "**Q**: Prove n-step Sarsa return equals novel TD error form.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**:\n",
    "Start with $G_{t:t+n} = Q_{t-1}(S_t, A_t) + \\sum_{k=t}^{t+n-1} \\gamma^{k-t} [R_{k+1} + \\gamma Q_k(S_{k+1}, A_{k+1}) - Q_{k-1}(S_k, A_k)]$.\n",
    "- By induction: Base $n=1$ holds; assume for n-1, expand recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 7.5 Solution\n",
    "**Q**: Pseudocode for off-policy state-value prediction with CV.\n",

    "#       V(St) += α * (G - V(St))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 7.6 Solution\n",
    "Q: Why per-decision methods better than ordinary IS for off-policy MC?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Per-decision applies IS only to relevant steps, adding CV to reduce variance (ignores low-prob branches without zeroing entire return).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 7.7 Solution\n",
    "Q: Prove per-decision off-policy return expectation equals on-policy return.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: By induction on horizon h:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base: $E[G_{h-1:h}] = E[R_h] = v_π(S_{h-1})$.\n",
